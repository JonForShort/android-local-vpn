# Android Local VPN

This project is a simple [VPN](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/vpn) for Android written in the Rust programming language.  It uses [smoltcp](https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp) for its TCP/IP stack.

## Goals

* Performant - Performance running local VPN should be comparable to performance without running VPN.
* Small - Library should be less than 1 MB in size.
* Easy To Use - Integration should be simple.

## Integration

TBD
